# Tinker's Selector
## Built using NextJS and TailwindCSS
#### Tinkers' Construct adds various patterns which allows the player to make tool parts out of various materials such as Cactus, Paper and Obsidian. Each material has a unique property to it and may enhance the capabilities of the final product. It offers a large choice of tools ranging from normal pickaxes and shovels to the Hammer which will clear any stone/ores in a 3x3 area and the Mattock which is a combination of an axe, shovel and a hoe. Customizable arrows and bows are also available.

#### This website aims to help compare different tools in Tinker's construct and supported mods, I'd love feedback, keep in mind that the UI is meant to be barebones, but I'd appreciate help in the formulas and the damage and durability calculations as I've built the website with a decent number of publicly available formulas and still need a bunch for damage and other calculations.

## NOTE: Some of the calculations are still currently unavailable due to lack of availability of formulas, but if you get/or know any, let me know!
